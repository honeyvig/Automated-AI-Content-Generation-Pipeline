# Automated-AI-Content-Generation-Pipeline
I would like to build an automated content generation AI that does the following:
1- generate scenarios (for example, a conversation between two people)
2- reflect the result into designs (texts from person 1 properly fitting a message bubble...etc), I will provide the designs and you just need to fill/adjust it to properly show the new content
3- create a video based on that (proper order of screenshots and sound)
4 - upload the video to tiktok/instagram

I want this pipeline to work on two different apps in two different categories, we can meet to discuss the requirements. 
====================
To build an automated content generation AI pipeline that generates scenarios, adjusts designs, creates videos, and uploads to platforms like TikTok and Instagram, we can break the process into a series of tasks that integrate AI, design manipulation, video creation, and API usage.

Here's how the overall workflow could be structured:
1. Generate Scenarios (AI-powered Text Generation)

    The first step is generating the conversation (scenario) using a language model like GPT-3 or GPT-4. This can be done via an API call to OpenAI to generate a conversation between two people.

2. Reflect the Result into Designs

    Once we have the generated conversation, we will place the conversation in pre-designed templates (message bubbles, etc.). This can be done using Python libraries like Pillow for image manipulation.

3. Create a Video Based on the Design

    After the design is prepared (multiple images), we can convert these designs into a video. This can be done using OpenCV or MoviePy to compile images into a video and add sound (optional).

4. Upload Video to TikTok/Instagram

    Finally, we can use TikTok or Instagram APIs (or third-party tools) to upload the video. For TikTok, you may need to use TikTok's Developer API, and for Instagram, you can use Instagram's Graph API for media uploads.

Here’s an implementation outline for each step, using Python:
Step 1: Generate Scenarios (Text Generation)

Using OpenAI's GPT-3/4 API to generate a conversation:

import openai

openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

def generate_conversation(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    conversation = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return conversation

# Example prompt to generate a conversation
prompt = "Generate a conversation between two people discussing their favorite movies."
conversation = generate_conversation(prompt)
print(conversation)

Step 2: Reflect the Result into Designs (Message Bubbles)

Using Pillow to create an image with the conversation in message bubbles:

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont

def create_message_image(conversation):
    # Create an image with a white background
    img = Image.new('RGB', (500, 500), color = 'white')
    d = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    font = ImageFont.load_default()

    # Split the conversation into two parts (person1 and person2)
    messages = conversation.split("\n")
    y = 10  # Start position for the first message

    # Adjust message bubbles
    for i, msg in enumerate(messages):
        # Set the text color depending on the speaker
        if i % 2 == 0:
            d.rectangle([10, y, 490, y + 40], fill=(173, 216, 230))  # Person 1's bubble (light blue)
            d.text((15, y+5), msg, fill="black", font=font)
        else:
            d.rectangle([10, y, 490, y + 40], fill=(255, 182, 193))  # Person 2's bubble (light pink)
            d.text((15, y+5), msg, fill="black", font=font)

        y += 50  # Increase y position for the next message

    # Save image
    img.save("conversation_image.png")
    img.show()

# Example usage
create_message_image(conversation)

Step 3: Create a Video from Images

Use MoviePy to turn the images into a video and add sound:

from moviepy.editor import *

def create_video_from_images(image_files, audio_file=None):
    clips = []
    
    # Add each image to the video
    for image_file in image_files:
        img_clip = ImageClip(image_file).set_duration(2)  # Each image lasts 2 seconds
        clips.append(img_clip)
    
    # Concatenate all clips into a final video
    video = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="compose")
    
    # Add audio if provided
    if audio_file:
        audio = AudioFileClip(audio_file)
        video = video.set_audio(audio)
    
    # Write the video to a file
    video.write_videofile("final_video.mp4", codec="libx264")

# Example usage (replace with actual file paths)
image_files = ["conversation_image.png"]  # List of image paths to be used in the video
create_video_from_images(image_files)

Step 4: Upload Video to TikTok/Instagram

For TikTok, we can use their API to upload videos (you’ll need to have an API key and proper OAuth authentication).

Example for Instagram using Instagram Graph API:

import requests

def upload_video_to_instagram(video_file_path, access_token, user_id):
    # Upload the video
    url = f'https://graph-video.facebook.com/v15.0/{user_id}/videos'
    payload = {
        'access_token': access_token,
        'file': open(video_file_path, 'rb')
    }
    response = requests.post(url, files={'file': open(video_file_path, 'rb')}, data=payload)
    
    # Check the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Video uploaded successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to upload video. Response: {response.text}")

# Example usage (replace with actual data)
access_token = "your-access-token"
user_id = "your-user-id"
video_file_path = "final_video.mp4"
upload_video_to_instagram(video_file_path, access_token, user_id)

Full Pipeline Flow:

    Generate Conversation: Use OpenAI's API to generate a conversation between two people.
    Create Design: Use Pillow to place the conversation in message bubbles.
    Create Video: Use MoviePy to convert images into a video and add sound.
    Upload: Upload the video to TikTok/Instagram using their APIs.

Conclusion:

This pipeline can be adapted based on specific requirements for the two apps you want to target. You can integrate more sophisticated AI models to create more complex scenarios and further customize the design and video output. For uploading to TikTok, you will need to handle API access carefully, as it might require special access through TikTok's business API or third-party services that facilitate posting.
